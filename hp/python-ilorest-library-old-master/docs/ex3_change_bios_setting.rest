First create an instance of Rest or Redfish Object using the  **RestObject** or **RedfishObject** class respectively. The class constructor takes iLO hostname/ ip address formatted as a string ("https://xx.xx.xx.xx"), iLO login username and password as arguments. The class also initializes a login session, gets systems resources and message registries.

Rest Object creation:

.. code-block:: python

 REST_OBJ = RestObject(iLO_https_host, login_account, login_password)

::

Redfish Object creation:

.. code-block:: python

 REDFISH_OBJ = RedfishObject(iLO_https_host, login_account, login_password)

::

Example 3: Change BIOS setting
==============================

This is an example from RestfulApiExamples.py that can be used to change system BIOS settings. The example in RedfishApiExamples.py  is similar except that a rest object is replaced by a redfish object.

The method **ex3_change_bios_setting** takes an instance of rest object, BIOS property of interest, the new value for the BIOS property and BIOS password as arguments.

.. code-block:: python


  def ex3_change_bios_setting(restobj, bios_property, property_value, login_password,
                              bios_password):

::

Find and get the BIOS settings URI from the systems resources collection. 

.. code-block:: python


     instances = restobj.search_for_type("Bios.")

::

For the BIOS settings URI/s prepare the request body with only the BIOS property we want to change and perform the PATCH request.

.. code-block:: python

        for instance in instances:
           body = {bios_property: property_value}
           response = restobj.rest_patch(instance["href"], body, \
                                            optionalpassword=bios_password)
           restobj.error_handler(response)

::



A successful PATCH response will set the BIOS property value to the new value provided in BIOS settings, however the BIOS setting changes will get affected only after a system reset or reboot.

**Note:** The Bios. type is not supported in Gen9 servers for Redfish but the example includes Redfish implementation for Redfish Bios. type support in Gen10. Rest works as intended.
