Why HPE iLO RESTful SDK?
-----------------------

This HPE RESTful API for iLO will become the main management API for iLO and iLO Chassis Manager
based HPE servers. Its feature set will become larger than the existing iLO XML API (RIBCL) and IPMI
interfaces. Using this API, you can take full inventory of the server, control power and reset, configure
BIOS and iLO settings, fetch event logs, as well as many other functions.

This API follows the trend of the Internet in moving to a common pattern for new software interfaces.
Many web services in a variety of industries use REST APIs because they are easy to implement,
easy to consume, and offer scalability advantages over previous technologies. HPE OneView,
OpenStack, and many other server management APIs are now REST APIs. Most HPE Management
software offerings, as well as the entire Software Defined Data Center architecture, are built upon
REST APIs.

The HPE RESTful API for iLO has the additional advantage of consistency across all present and
projected server architectures. The same data model works for traditional rack-mount servers,
blades, as well as newer types of systems like Moonshot. This advantage comes because the data
model is designed to self-describe the serviceâ€™s capabilities to the client and has room for flexibility
designed in from the start.


Resource operations
-------------------

RESTful APIs are stateless. The resource manager maintains the resource state that is reported as
the resource representation. The client maintains the application state and the client might manipulate
the resource locally, but until a PATCH or POST is made, the resource, as known by the resource
manager, is not changed.
