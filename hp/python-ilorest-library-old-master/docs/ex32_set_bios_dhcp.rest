First create an instance of Rest or Redfish Object using the  **RestObject** or **RedfishObject** class respectively. The class constructor takes iLO hostname/ ip address formatted as a string ("https://xx.xx.xx.xx"), iLO login username and password as arguments. The class also initializes a login session, gets systems resources and message registries.

Rest Object creation:

.. code-block:: python

 REST_OBJ = RestObject(iLO_https_host, login_account, login_password)

::

Redfish Object creation:

.. code-block:: python

 REDFISH_OBJ = RedfishObject(iLO_https_host, login_account, login_password)

::

Example 32: Set BIOS DHCP
=============================

The method **ex32_set_bios_dhcp** takes an instance of rest object ( or redfish object if using Redfish API ) and DHCP properties as arguments.

.. code-block:: python

  def ex32_set_bios_dhcp(restobj, bios_properties, bios_password=None):

::

Find and get the BIOS settings URI from the systems resources collection.

.. code-block:: python


     instances = restobj.search_for_type("Bios.")

::

For the DHCP settings prepare the request body with only the DHCP settings we want to change and perform the PATCH request.

.. code-block:: python

    for instance in instances:
        response = restobj.rest_patch(instance["href"], bios_properties, \
                                      bios_password)
        restobj.error_handler(response)
::

A successful PATCH response will set the DHCP values to the new values provided in DHCP settings, however the changes will go into effect only after a system reset or reboot.

**Note:** The Bios. type is not supported in Gen9 servers for Redfish but the example includes Redfish implementation for Redfish Bios. type support in Gen10. Rest works as intended.
