First create an instance of Rest or Redfish Object using the  **RestObject** or **RedfishObject** class respectively. The class constructor takes iLO hostname/ ip address formatted as a string ("https://xx.xx.xx.xx", "https://box1.america.corp.net" both work!), iLO login username and password as arguments. The class also initializes a login session, gets systems resources and message registries.

Rest Object creation:

.. code-block:: python

 REST_OBJ = RestObject(iLO_https_url, login_account, login_password)

::

Redfish Object creation:

.. code-block:: python

 REDFISH_OBJ = RedfishObject(iLO_https_url, login_account, login_password)

::

Example 48: Set BIOS password
==============================

The method **ex48_set_bios_password** takes an instance of rest object, bios property of interest, the new value for the bios property and bios password as arguments.

.. code-block:: python


  def ex48_set_bios_password(restobj, new_password, bios_password):

::

Find and get the BIOS settings URI from the systems resources collection. 

.. code-block:: python


     instances = restobj.search_for_type("Bios.")

::

For the BIOS settings URI/s prepare the request body with the password we want to change and perform the PATCH request.

.. code-block:: python

        for instance in instances:
            body = {"AdminPassword": new_password, \
                "OldAdminPassword": bios_password}
            response = restobj.rest_patch(instance["href"], body, \
                                      bios_password)
            restobj.error_handler(response)

::



A successful PATCH response will set the BIOS password with the new BIOS password, however the BIOS setting changes will get affected only after a system reset or reboot. Additionally, bios_password is a required parameter in this case, since both the new and old password must be supplied for this command to work.

**Note:** The Bios. type is not supported in Gen9 servers for Redfish but the example includes Redfish implementation for Redfish Bios. type support in Gen10. Rest works as intended.
