Description
----------
The python-ilorest-library is a python library built for interacting with the Redfish API remotely to any BMC that 
implements a Redfish API or any HPE system locally. The library also supports HPE's legacy REST API. Go to the library
`documentation <https://pages.github.hpe.com/intelligent-provisioning/python-redfish-library/>`_ for more details.

HPE RESTful API for iLO is a RESTful application programming interface for the
management of iLO and iLO Chassis Manager based HPE servers. REST
(Representational State Transfer) is a web based software architectural style
consisting of a set of constraints that focuses on a system's resources. iLO
REST library performs the basic HTTP operations GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and
DELETE on resources using the HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application
State) REST architecture. The API allows the clients to manage and interact
with iLO through a fixed URL and several URIs. Go to the API 
`documentation <https://hewlettpackard.github.io/ilo-rest-api-docs/>`_
for more details.
